# Spinodal-DecompositionEuler
MATLAB script for generating videos from the Cahn-Hilliard model of phase separation. Utilizes forward Euler method. Documentation can be found within the main file 'spinodal_decomposition.m'. Video included was generated with the parameters D = 10, gamma = 5, dt = 0.005, gridSize = 200, numIterations = 5000, captureMode = "standard".
